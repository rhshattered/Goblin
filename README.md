## Installing 
### Tips
if you are on linux or mac we assume that you know how to use premake </br>
on those corresponding platforms. If not https://premake.github.io/download </br>
should have all the binaries you need to download to get goblin running. </br>
</br>
GenerateProjects.bat wont work on linux/mac for multiple reasons so you will have to </br>
manually command line project generation </br>
</br>
Update your graphics drivers always when dealing with gpu driven software such as Goblin. </br>
</br>
### Common Issues
First Build failing on visual studio </br>
--Reason DLL not built first causing sandbox to not find it </br>
---Fixed by building twice </br>

### Clone </br>
```
# This is the command to properly clone it
# It is reccomended to clone into a folder not to desktop
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ttvtempest17/Goblin
```

### Ideal Development
Since Goblin is created with Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019 </br>
Premake favors it as it has some settings not available to other ide's. </br>

New graphics cards are something Goblin loves because of Vulkan. </br>
